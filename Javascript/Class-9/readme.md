2. Validate AI output  – Detect bugs, inefficiencies, and security issues.
3. AI is a tool, not a replacement – You must guide and correct its output.
4. Build problem-solving skills – Experience real coding challenges and debugging.
5. Develop technical intuition – Learn best practices through hands-on coding.
6. Enable customization – Modify and personalize AI-generated projects.
7. Improve creativity – Combine design ideas with technical skill.
8. Enhance career value – Employers need devs who understand and maintain code.
9. Spot AI mistakes – Identify outdated syntax, poor accessibility, or bad logic.
10. Build confidence – Know *why* something works, not just *that* it works.
